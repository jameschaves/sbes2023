## Abstract
**Context:** Agile Software Development (ASD) is widely used in software development. However, one of the most critical phases in software development, Requirements Engineering (RE), can be overwhelming for ASD values. In RE for ASD, we need to find the right balance for the plan and documentation that do not spoil ASD values.
**Objectives:** investigate what issues RE for ASD has been facing and what academia has done to solve these issues to exploit all of the capabilities of ASD beyond traditional RE.
**Methods:** We conducted a Tertiary Study, also a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), in secondary studies published until 31st December 2022, looking for issues and potential solutions for Requirement Engineering (RE) for Agile Software Development (ASD) over the years and highlighting the more recent and used solutions.
**Results:** After executing the SLR protocol, we accepted 41 out of 254 studies and encountered ten main issues and 136 solutions used by academia for RE for ASD.
**Conclusions:** On highlighting the remaining issues and the more recent and frequent RE solutions for ASD, we concluded that ASD suffers from inherent problems since the beginning that remains still, and no solutions go beyond traditional RE techniques to help solve these issues.
